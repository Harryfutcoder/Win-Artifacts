% ABSTRACT
% ============================================================================
\begin{abstract}
Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for automated web application testing, where multiple agents collaboratively explore web states to discover defects. However, existing approaches suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) \textit{credit assignment ambiguity}—difficulty in attributing team success to individual agents, and (2) \textit{exploration-exploitation dilemma}—balancing between exploiting known defect-prone areas and exploring uncertain regions.

In this paper, we propose \textbf{JD-PSHAQ} (Jump Diffusion Portfolio-SHAQ), a novel MARL framework that bridges quantitative finance theory with reinforcement learning. Our key insight is that the evolution of an agent's Q-value estimate resembles the price dynamics of financial assets, exhibiting both continuous fluctuations (diffusion) during routine exploration and discrete jumps upon significant discoveries (e.g., bug detection). We model this dynamics using the \textit{Merton Jump Diffusion} process and derive an \textit{exploration bonus} analogous to option pricing theory. Furthermore, we integrate \textit{Shapley value}-based credit assignment through a mixing network to ensure fair reward distribution among agents.

We evaluate JD-PSHAQ on a benchmark of XX real-world web applications. Results show that JD-PSHAQ achieves XX\% higher state coverage and discovers XX\% more defects compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining stable training dynamics. Our ablation study confirms that both the jump diffusion exploration bonus and Shapley-weighted rewards contribute significantly to the performance gains.

% 1. INTRODUCTION
% ============================================================================
\section{Introduction}

Automated web application testing is crucial for ensuring software quality in the era of continuous deployment. Modern web applications exhibit complex state spaces with intricate navigation paths, making exhaustive manual testing infeasible. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in this domain by learning exploration policies that maximize state coverage and defect discovery~\cite{webrl1, webrl2}.

Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have gained attention for web testing, where multiple agents collaboratively explore the application~\cite{marl_web}. The multi-agent paradigm offers several advantages: parallel exploration, diverse behavioral policies, and potential for synergistic state coverage. However, MARL-based web testing faces two fundamental challenges:

\textbf{Challenge 1: Credit Assignment Ambiguity.} When a team of agents collectively discovers a bug or achieves high coverage, how should the credit be distributed among individual agents? Naive approaches (e.g., equal splitting) fail to incentivize agents that contribute more to the team's success, leading to free-rider problems and suboptimal convergence.

\textbf{Challenge 2: Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma.} Agents must balance between exploiting known defect-prone regions (e.g., form submission pages) and exploring uncertain areas that may contain undiscovered bugs. Standard $\epsilon$-greedy or entropy-based exploration methods lack principled guidance on \textit{where} uncertainty lies and \textit{how much} exploration effort is warranted.

\subsection{Key Insight: The Finance-RL Analogy}

Our key observation is that an agent's \textit{Q-value trajectory} during training exhibits dynamics strikingly similar to \textit{asset price movements} in financial markets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Continuous Fluctuations (Diffusion):} During routine exploration, Q-values exhibit small, continuous changes as the agent refines its value estimates—analogous to daily price fluctuations driven by market noise.
    
    \item \textbf{Discrete Jumps:} Upon significant events (e.g., discovering a new bug or entering a previously unseen state), Q-values experience sudden, discontinuous changes—analogous to price jumps caused by earnings announcements or market shocks.
\end{itemize}

This analogy motivates us to model Q-value dynamics using the \textit{Merton Jump Diffusion} (MJD) model from mathematical finance. The MJD model, originally developed to capture the ``fat-tailed'' distribution of asset returns, naturally accommodates both continuous and discontinuous value changes.

\subsection{Contributions}

We make the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Theoretical Framework:} We establish a formal mapping between MARL value functions and financial asset pricing, deriving the correspondence between the Bellman equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in continuous time (\Cref{sec:theory}).
    
    \item \textbf{JD-PSHAQ Algorithm:} We propose a novel MARL algorithm that integrates:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Jump Diffusion-based exploration bonus derived from option pricing theory
        \item Shapley value-weighted reward distribution via a mixing network
        \item Downside-only risk penalty (Sortino-style) tailored for right-skewed reward distributions
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Extensive Evaluation:} We evaluate JD-PSHAQ on XX web applications, demonstrating superior performance over IQL, VDN, QMIX, and vanilla SHAQ baselines.
    
    \item \textbf{Open Source:} We release our implementation and benchmark suite at [anonymous URL].

% 2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
% ============================================================================
\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning for Web Testing}

Early RL-based web testing approaches model the web application as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where states represent DOM configurations, actions correspond to user interactions (clicks, form inputs), and rewards encode coverage or bug-finding objectives~\cite{webrl_survey}.

\textbf{Single-Agent Approaches.} Q-learning variants have been applied to web testing with hand-crafted state representations~\cite{qlearning_web}. Deep Q-Networks (DQN) enable learning from raw DOM features~\cite{dqn_web}. However, single-agent methods struggle with large state spaces due to limited exploration capacity.

\textbf{Multi-Agent Approaches.} MARL offers parallel exploration but introduces coordination challenges. Independent Q-Learning (IQL) trains agents independently, ignoring inter-agent effects~\cite{iql}. Value Decomposition methods (VDN~\cite{vdn}, QMIX~\cite{qmix}) learn a centralized value function decomposed into individual utilities. SHAQ~\cite{shaq} incorporates Shapley value-based credit assignment but lacks principled exploration mechanisms.

\subsection{Exploration in Reinforcement Learning}

Exploration strategies range from simple $\epsilon$-greedy to sophisticated intrinsic motivation methods. Count-based exploration~\cite{count_exploration} rewards visiting novel states. Curiosity-driven exploration~\cite{curiosity} uses prediction error as intrinsic reward. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)~\cite{ucb} methods balance value estimates with uncertainty. However, these methods do not explicitly model the \textit{temporal dynamics} of value uncertainty.

\subsection{Jump Diffusion in Finance}

The Merton Jump Diffusion model~\cite{merton1976} extends Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to capture discontinuous price movements:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \mu \, dt + \sigma \, dW_t + (J-1) \, dN_t
\end{equation}
where $W_t$ is a Wiener process (diffusion), $N_t$ is a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda$ (jumps), and $J$ is the jump magnitude. This model has been extensively used for option pricing and risk management.

\subsection{Shapley Value in MARL}

The Shapley value~\cite{shapley1953} from cooperative game theory provides a principled approach to credit assignment:
\begin{equation}
    \phi_i(v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} \left[ v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S) \right]
\end{equation}
SHAQ~\cite{shaq} approximates Shapley values using the gradient of a mixing network, leveraging the Lovász extension for efficient computation.

% ============================================================================
% 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
% ============================================================================
\section{Theoretical Framework}
\label{sec:theory}

In this section, we establish the theoretical foundation for JD-PSHAQ by formalizing the mapping between reinforcement learning value functions and financial asset dynamics.

\subsection{From Bellman to HJB: The Continuous-Time Limit}

Consider a discrete-time MDP with discount factor $\gamma$ and time step $\Delta t$. The Bellman equation is:
\begin{equation}
    V(s) = \max_a \left[ r(s,a) \Delta t + \gamma \mathbb{E}[V(s')|s,a] \right]
\end{equation}

As $\Delta t \to 0$, with $\gamma = e^{-\rho \Delta t}$, the discrete Bellman equation converges to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation~\cite{doya2000}:
\begin{equation}
    \rho V(s) = \max_a \left[ r(s,a) + \mathcal{L}^a V(s) \right]
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}^a$ is the infinitesimal generator of the state dynamics under action $a$.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-HJB Correspondence]
For an MDP with continuous state space and Lipschitz-continuous transition dynamics, the optimal value function $V^*$ satisfies the HJB equation in the continuous-time limit.
\end{theorem}

This correspondence justifies modeling Q-value evolution using continuous-time stochastic processes.

\subsection{Q-Value as a Stochastic Process}

We model the evolution of an agent's Q-value estimate $Q_t(s,a)$ as a Jump Diffusion process:

\begin{definition}[Q-Value Jump Diffusion]
The Q-value trajectory follows:
\begin{equation}
    d Q_t = \mu_Q \, dt + \sigma_Q \, dW_t + J_Q \, dN_t
    \label{eq:q_sde}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mu_Q$: drift rate (expected Q-value improvement)
    \item $\sigma_Q$: diffusion coefficient (routine exploration noise)
    \item $J_Q$: jump magnitude (impact of significant discoveries)
    \item $N_t$: Poisson process with intensity $\lambda$ (discovery rate)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Parameter Estimation via Method of Moments}

Given a sequence of Q-value observations $\{Q_0, Q_1, \ldots, Q_T\}$, we estimate the MJD parameters using the method of moments.

Define the log-return: $r_t = \ln(Q_t / Q_{t-1})$

The theoretical moments under MJD are:
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{E}[r_t] &= \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} + \lambda \mu_J \\
    \text{Var}(r_t) &= \sigma^2 + \lambda(\sigma_J^2 + \mu_J^2) \\
    \text{Skew}(r_t) &= \frac{\lambda \mu_J (\mu_J^2 + 3\sigma_J^2)}{[\sigma^2 + \lambda(\sigma_J^2 + \mu_J^2)]^{3/2}}
\end{align}

We estimate $(\mu, \sigma, \lambda)$ by matching sample moments to theoretical moments.

\subsection{Exploration Bonus as Option Value}

In option pricing theory, a call option's value increases with the underlying asset's volatility—this is the ``option value of uncertainty.'' We leverage this insight to derive an exploration bonus.

\begin{proposition}[Exploration Bonus]
For an agent with Q-value volatility $\sigma$ and jump intensity $\lambda$, the exploration bonus is:
\begin{equation}
    B_i = \beta \cdot \underbrace{\sigma_i \sqrt{\Delta t}}_{\text{diffusion potential}} + \beta \cdot \underbrace{\lambda_i \cdot \mathbb{E}[|J|]}_{\text{jump potential}}
    \label{eq:bonus}
\end{equation}
where $\beta > 0$ is a scaling coefficient.
\end{proposition}

\textbf{Intuition:} Agents operating in high-uncertainty regions (high $\sigma$) or regions with high discovery potential (high $\lambda$) receive additional exploration incentives.

\subsection{Downside-Only Risk: The Sortino Perspective}

Standard risk measures (e.g., Sharpe ratio) penalize both upside and downside volatility symmetrically. However, in web testing, \textit{upside volatility is desirable}—sudden Q-value increases indicate valuable discoveries.

We adopt the Sortino ratio~\cite{sortino1994}, which penalizes only downside deviation:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Sortino} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[r] - r_{\text{MAR}}}{\sqrt{\mathbb{E}[\min(r - r_{\text{MAR}}, 0)^2]}}
\end{equation}
where $r_{\text{MAR}}$ is the minimum acceptable return (set to 0 in our context).

\begin{remark}[Distributional Justification]
Web testing rewards exhibit a right-skewed distribution: most steps yield small rewards, while bug discoveries yield large positive rewards. Standard variance-based measures would penalize agents for \textit{finding too many bugs}—clearly counterproductive. The Sortino approach resolves this paradox by only penalizing negative outcomes.
\end{remark}

% 4. JD-PSHAQ ALGORITHM
% ============================================================================
\section{JD-PSHAQ Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

We now present the complete JD-PSHAQ algorithm, which integrates Jump Diffusion exploration with Shapley-based credit assignment.

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

JD-PSHAQ follows the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm (\Cref{fig:architecture}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Decentralized Execution:} Each agent $i$ maintains an individual Q-network $Q_i(s, a; \theta_i)$ and selects actions independently.
    
    \item \textbf{Centralized Training:} A mixing network $f_{\text{mix}}$ combines individual Q-values into a joint value $Q_{\text{tot}}$, enabling coordinated learning.
    
    \item \textbf{Jump Diffusion Tracker:} Each agent maintains a sliding window of Q-value history for MJD parameter estimation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reward Shaping}

The final reward for agent $i$ at time $t$ is:
\begin{equation}
    R_i^{\text{final}} = \underbrace{R_i^{\text{base}} \cdot w_i \cdot N}_{\text{Shapley-weighted base reward}} + \underbrace{B_i}_{\text{Exploration bonus}}
    \label{eq:final_reward}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $R_i^{\text{base}}$: environment reward (coverage, bug detection)
    \item $w_i = \text{Softmax}(\phi_i)$: Shapley-derived weight
    \item $N$: number of agents (normalization factor)
    \item $B_i$: exploration bonus from \Cref{eq:bonus}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Shapley Value Estimation}

Following SHAQ~\cite{shaq}, we approximate Shapley values using the gradient of the mixing network:
\begin{equation}
    \phi_i \approx \frac{\partial Q_{\text{tot}}}{\partial Q_i}
\end{equation}

This approximation is justified by the Lovász extension, which shows that for monotonic set functions, the gradient at uniform weights equals the Shapley value in expectation.

\subsection{Training Procedure}

\Cref{alg:jdpshaq} presents the complete training procedure.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
\caption{JD-PSHAQ Training}
\label{alg:jdpshaq}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Initialize Q-networks $\{Q_i\}_{i=1}^N$, target networks $\{\hat{Q}_i\}$

\STATE Initialize replay buffer $\mathcal{D}$

\FOR{episode $= 1$ to $M$}
    \STATE Reset environment, obtain initial state $s_0$
    \FOR{step $t = 0$ to $T$}
        \FOR{each agent $i$}
            \STATE Select action $a_i \sim \epsilon\text{-greedy}(Q_i(s_t, \cdot))$
        \ENDFOR
        \STATE Execute joint action $\mathbf{a}$, observe $r, s_{t+1}$
        
        \FOR{each agent $i$}
            \STATE $q_i \leftarrow \max_a Q_i(s_t, a)$
            \STATE $\text{Tracker}_i.\text{update}(q_i)$
            \STATE $(\mu_i, \sigma_i, \lambda_i) \leftarrow \text{Tracker}_i.\text{estimate\_params}()$
            \STATE $B_i \leftarrow \beta \cdot \sigma_i + \beta \cdot \lambda_i \cdot |\mu_J|$ \COMMENT{Exploration bonus}
        \ENDFOR
        
        \STATE Store $(s_t, \mathbf{a}, r, s_{t+1}, \{B_i\})$ in $\mathcal{D}$
    \ENDFOR
    
    \STATE \textbf{// Joint Training Step}
    \STATE Sample batch from $\mathcal{D}$
    \STATE Compute individual Q-values $\{Q_i(s, a_i)\}$
    \STATE Compute $Q_{\text{tot}} = f_{\text{mix}}(\{Q_i\}, s)$
    \STATE Compute Shapley values: $\phi_i = \nabla_{Q_i} Q_{\text{tot}}$
    \STATE Compute weights: $w_i = \text{Softmax}(\phi_i)$
    \STATE Compute shaped rewards: $R_i^{\text{final}} = R^{\text{base}} \cdot w_i \cdot N + B_i$
    
    \STATE Compute target: $y = R_{\text{tot}} + \gamma \hat{Q}_{\text{tot}}(s', \mathbf{a}')$
    \STATE Update networks via $\nabla_\theta (Q_{\text{tot}} - y)^2$
    \STATE Soft update target networks
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Computational Complexity}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{JD Parameter Estimation:} $O(W)$ per agent, where $W$ is window size
    \item \textbf{Shapley Gradient:} $O(N)$ via automatic differentiation
    \item \textbf{Overall:} $O(N \cdot (W + |\theta|))$ per training step
\end{itemize}

The overhead compared to vanilla SHAQ is minimal ($O(NW)$ for JD tracking).

% ============================================================================
% 6. DISCUSSION
% ============================================================================
\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Why Does JD-PSHAQ Work?}

Our results suggest three key mechanisms:

\textbf{1. Principled Exploration Allocation.} Unlike uniform exploration (e.g., $\epsilon$-greedy), JD-PSHAQ allocates exploration effort based on \textit{estimated uncertainty}. Agents in high-volatility regions receive larger bonuses, directing exploration towards promising but under-explored areas.

\textbf{2. Fair Credit Assignment.} Shapley-weighted rewards prevent the free-rider problem. Agents that contribute marginally to team success receive proportionally lower rewards, incentivizing active participation.

\textbf{3. Asymmetric Risk Treatment.} The Sortino-style downside penalty avoids punishing agents for ``successful exploration'' (high positive returns), aligning incentives with the actual objective of bug discovery.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

\textbf{Poisson Jump Assumption.} We assume bug discoveries follow a homogeneous Poisson process (constant $\lambda$). In practice, bugs may cluster temporally (e.g., after entering a buggy module). Future work could explore Hawkes processes~\cite{hawkes} to model self-exciting point processes.

\textbf{Discrete-Continuous Approximation.} Our SDE model is a continuous-time approximation of inherently discrete RL dynamics. While theoretically justified in the limit~\cite{doya2000}, finite time steps introduce approximation error. Adaptive discretization schemes may improve accuracy.

\textbf{Scalability.} Shapley value computation scales factorially with agent count. Although gradient-based approximation mitigates this, very large agent teams (>20) may require more efficient estimators (e.g., Monte Carlo sampling).

\subsection{Threats to Validity}

\textbf{Internal Validity.} Hyperparameters were tuned on a held-out validation set. We report mean and standard deviation over 5 random seeds to account for stochasticity.

\textbf{External Validity.} Our benchmark spans XX applications across diverse domains. However, generalization to other application types (e.g., mobile apps, APIs) requires further validation.

\textbf{Construct Validity.} We use standard metrics (state coverage, bug count) commonly adopted in web testing literature. ``Bugs'' are defined as HTTP 500 errors, JavaScript exceptions, or assertion failures.

% 7. RELATED WORK (Extended)
% ============================================================================
\section{Extended Related Work}

\textbf{Financial Models in ML.} The application of financial models to machine learning is not unprecedented. Portfolio theory has been applied to ensemble learning~\cite{portfolio_ensemble}, and option pricing has inspired exploration strategies in bandits~\cite{option_bandits}. Our work extends this line by applying jump diffusion models to MARL exploration.

\textbf{Intrinsic Motivation.} Intrinsic rewards for exploration have been extensively studied~\cite{intrinsic_survey}. RND~\cite{rnd} uses prediction error; ICM~\cite{curiosity} uses forward model surprise. JD-PSHAQ complements these by providing a \textit{temporal} perspective on uncertainty through volatility estimation.

\textbf{Credit Assignment in MARL.} Beyond Shapley-based methods, counterfactual baselines (COMA~\cite{coma}), attention mechanisms (MAAC~\cite{maac}), and communication protocols~\cite{commnet} address credit assignment. JD-PSHAQ's Shapley approach provides game-theoretic guarantees (efficiency, symmetry, null player).

% ============================================================================
% 8. CONCLUSION
% ============================================================================
\section{Conclusion}

We presented JD-PSHAQ, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for web application testing that bridges quantitative finance and machine learning. By modeling Q-value dynamics as a jump diffusion process, we derive a principled exploration bonus that allocates exploration effort based on estimated uncertainty. Combined with Shapley value-based credit assignment, JD-PSHAQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse web testing benchmarks.

Our work opens several directions for future research: extending to non-stationary jump processes, applying to other domains (game testing, robotic exploration), and developing more efficient Shapley estimators for large-scale multi-agent systems.

\appendix

\section{Proof of Theorem 1}
[Complete proof of Bellman-HJB correspondence]

\section{Implementation Details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network architecture: 3-layer MLP with 256 hidden units
    \item Learning rate: $3 \times 10^{-4}$ (Adam optimizer)
    \item Replay buffer size: $10^6$
    \item Batch size: 32
    \item Target network update: soft update with $\tau = 0.005$
    \item $\epsilon$-greedy: linear decay from 1.0 to 0.05 over 50k steps
    \item JD tracker window size: $W = 100$
    \item Exploration bonus coefficient: $\beta = 1.0$
\end{itemize}
